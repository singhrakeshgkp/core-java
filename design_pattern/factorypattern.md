# Factory Design Pattern
### Advantages
- Remove the object creation/instantiation logic from client code that makes code more robust and less coupled.
- Promote code for interface rather than implementation class.
- Provide abstraction between implementation and client class.
- example given in ```FactoryPatternExample1.java``` class

### Examples from JDK
- Many classess such as Calendar.getInstance, NumberFormat, ResourceBoundle use factory method design
- JaxBContext.createMarshaller, class.forName, charset.forname ..etc
