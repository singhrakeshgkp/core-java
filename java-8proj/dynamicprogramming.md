 # Dynamic Programming
 ## 1. Momoization
 - Calculate 50th Number of fibonacci sequence. refer ```CalculatingFibonacci.java```. To optimize fib function performance we have cached value, that will avoid repeated calculation of prev number.
 - Ways to move on a grid from start to end ```GridTraveler.java```
 - Getting given sum number from the given list of numbers ```TargetedSum.java```
 - What numbers can be used to achieve given sum ```NumbersUsedInTargetSum.java```
 - Write a function that accept a target string and an arrays of string. The function should return boolean whether or not the target string can be constructed using array of string ```ConstructTargetStr.java```
 - Write a functin that accept a targetStr and an arrays of string and  returns number of wasy we can construct the targetStr. refer ```CountConstructTargetStr.java```
 - Write a function that accept a targetStr and an arrays of String and returns all the possible combination used to construct the targetStr. refer ```AllConstructTargetStr.java```


## 2. Tabulation
- Calculate 50th Fib Number using tabulation method refer ```FibTabulationEx.java```
- Ways to Move on a grid from start to end refer ```TabulationGridTraveler.java```
- Getting Given Sum from given numbers in array. refer ```TabulationTargetSum.java```
- Get the list of numbrs used to obtain given sum. refer ```TabulationTargetHowSum.java```
- Get the min numbers can be used to get the target sum. refer ```TabulationBestSum.java```

## Q & A

1. CoinChangeProblem1-> No of ways change can be made
2. CoinChangeProblem2-> No of minimum coins required to make the change
3. CoinChangeProblem3-> No of minimum coins required to make the change with better time complexity
