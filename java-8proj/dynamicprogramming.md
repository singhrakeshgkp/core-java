 # Dynamic Programming
 ## 1. Momoization
 - Calculate 50th Number of fibonacci sequence. refer ```CalculatingFibonacci.java```. To optimize fib function performance we have cached value, that will avoid repeated calculation of prev number.
 - Ways to move on a grid from start to end ```GridTraveler.java```
 - Getting given sum number from the given list of numbers ```TargetedSum.java```
 - What numbers can be used to achieve given sum ```NumbersUsedInTargetSum.java```
 - Write a function that accept a target string and an arrays of string. The function should return boolean whether or not the target string can be constructed using array of string ```ConstructTargetStr.java```
- Count the number of ways to move through 6X9 Grid refer ```GridTraveler.java```

## 2. Tabulation

## Q & A

1. CoinChangeProblem1-> No of ways change can be made
2. CoinChangeProblem2-> No of minimum coins required to make the change
3. CoinChangeProblem3-> No of minimum coins required to make the change with better time complexity
