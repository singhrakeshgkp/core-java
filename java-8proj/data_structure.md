## Array
- Linear data structure
- Stores collection of data of same data types
- Elements are stored at contiguous memory location
  ### Operations on array
  - Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching
 ### Types of array
 - One dimentional, Multi dimentional. ex matrix
### Terminology
- Index---> In array elements are identified by their indexes, it usually start with 0
- Element--> are items stored in the array, can be accessed by their index.
- Length---> Array Length determined by number of ements it can contains.
  
## Linked List
- Linked list is linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, in linked list data are not stored in contiguous memory location.
- **Dynamic** Linked list can be resized by adding or removing nodes
- **Non-Contiguous Memory Location** Nodes are stored on random memory locations and connected by pointers
- **Sequential Access** Nodes can only be accessed sequently,starting from head of the list.
### Operations on linked list
- Creation(Creating new linked list), Insertion(adding new node in the specified position), Removal, Search, Traversal
### Types of linked list
- Singly, Doubly and Circular

## Stack
- Is a leaner data strucutre that follow a particular order LIFO/FILO
### Operations on stack
- push, pop, peek, size, isempty
### Applications of stack
- Function calls
- Expression Evaluation
- Bucktracking
- Udo/Redo operation
