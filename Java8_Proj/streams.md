### Stream Operations
 - allMatch, anyMatch
 - Close-> you can not use stream if its alredy closed(you will get ``` java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed ```)
 - dropwhile-> ``` dropWhile removes the elements that do match the predicate , until it finds an element that does not match the                           predicate.     From that point on it lets all elements pass through ```
